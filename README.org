#+TITLE: Antilock Braking System Slideshow for Revature

This is my ABS Slideshow for Revature. To compile the tex file,
simply type the command

#+begin_src sh
  pdflatex -shell-escape abs.tex
#+end_src

It requires LaTeX, gnuplot, and some LaTeX libraries that might
already be automatically installed if the 'right' distribution
of LaTeX was installed.
